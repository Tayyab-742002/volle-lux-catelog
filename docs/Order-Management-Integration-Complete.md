# Order Management Integration - Completion Summary

## ✅ Task 2.2.6 Completed Successfully

### Overview

Order management is integrated with Supabase, providing full order lifecycle management from creation to tracking.

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. **Order Service** (`services/orders/order.service.ts`)

- ✅ `createOrder()` - Creates order in Supabase with all details
- ✅ `getOrderById()` - Fetches order by ID with proper RLS
- ✅ `getUserOrders()` - Fetches all orders for a user
- ✅ `updateOrderStatus()` - Updates order status in Supabase
- ✅ `getOrderStatus()` - Gets current order status

#### 2. **Order History Page** (`app/account/orders/page.tsx`)

- ✅ Fetches orders from Supabase
- ✅ Displays orders in table/card format
- ✅ Handles authentication check
- ✅ Shows empty state for no orders
- ✅ Links to order detail page
- ✅ Responsive design

#### 3. **Order Detail Page** (`app/account/orders/[id]/page.tsx`)

- ✅ Fetches order by ID from Supabase
- ✅ Verifies user owns the order
- ✅ Displays complete order information
- ✅ Shows shipping address
- ✅ Lists all order items
- ✅ Shows order summary with pricing
- ✅ Handles authentication and authorization

### Key Features

#### 🔐 Security & Authorization

- Proper RLS policies enforce order isolation
- Users can only view their own orders
- Server-side authentication checks
- Authorization verification before display

#### 📊 Order Management

- Orders stored in Supabase with full details
- JSONB storage for flexible order items
- Status tracking (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- Timestamps for creation and updates

#### 🔍 Order Tracking

- Users can view all past orders
- Order details with items and pricing
- Shipping information display
- Status badges with color coding

### Database Schema

Orders are stored in the `orders` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.orders (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled')) DEFAULT 'pending',
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  currency TEXT DEFAULT 'USD',
  stripe_session_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  stripe_payment_intent_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  shipping_address JSONB NOT NULL,
  billing_address JSONB NOT NULL,
  items JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### RLS Policies

Order data is protected by Row Level Security:

- Users can only view their own orders
- Users can only insert their own orders
- Only admins can update order status (via service role)
- Order tracking is read-only for users

### Order Lifecycle

```
1. User adds items to cart
2. User proceeds to checkout
3. Order created in Supabase (via API/webhook)
4. Order status: 'pending'
5. Payment processed via Stripe
6. Order status: 'processing'
7. Order shipped (admin updates status)
8. Order status: 'shipped'
9. Order delivered (admin updates status)
10. Order status: 'delivered'
```

### File Structure

```
services/
└── orders/
    └── order.service.ts           # Order service with Supabase functions

app/
├── account/
│   └── orders/
│       ├── page.tsx               # Order history (fetches from Supabase)
│       └── [id]/
│           └── page.tsx           # Order details (fetches from Supabase)
└── api/
    └── checkout/
        └── route.ts               # Checkout API (creates orders)
```

### Testing

#### Manual Testing Checklist:

1. ✅ Create an order via checkout
2. ✅ View order history page
3. ✅ Click on an order to view details
4. ✅ Verify order information is correct
5. ✅ Verify authentication is required
6. ✅ Verify users can only see their own orders
7. ✅ Test order status badges
8. ✅ Test responsive design

#### Test Scenarios:

- **Authenticated User**: Should see all their orders
- **Guest User**: Should be prompted to sign in
- **Invalid Order ID**: Should show 404
- **Other User's Order**: Should show access denied
- **Empty Order History**: Should show empty state

### Status Color Coding

Orders display with color-coded status badges:

- **Delivered**: Green (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`)
- **Shipped**: Blue (`bg-blue-100 text-blue-800`)
- **Processing**: Yellow (`bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800`)
- **Cancelled**: Red (`bg-red-100 text-red-800`)
- **Pending**: Gray (`bg-gray-100 text-gray-800`)

### Error Handling

- Authentication errors handled gracefully
- Authorization checks prevent unauthorized access
- Not found pages for invalid order IDs
- Empty states for no orders
- Console logging for debugging

### Performance Optimizations

- Orders fetched server-side for SEO
- Efficient querying with indexed columns
- JSONB storage for flexible data
- Pagination support (future enhancement)

### Integration Points

Orders integrate with:

- ✅ Cart system (items come from cart)
- ✅ User authentication (user_id links to users)
- ✅ Payment processing (Stripe session IDs)
- ✅ Address management (shipping/billing addresses)

### Next Steps

The order management system is now functional. To complete the full order flow:

1. **Stripe Integration** (Task 2.3)
   - Update checkout API to create Stripe sessions
   - Handle webhook events
   - Update order status on payment success

2. **Email Notifications** (Task 2.4)
   - Send order confirmation emails
   - Send shipping notifications
   - Send delivery confirmations

3. **Admin Dashboard** (Future)
   - Order management interface
   - Status update functionality
   - Order fulfillment workflow

## ✅ Task 2.2.6 Status: COMPLETE

All deliverables have been met:

- ✅ Orders stored in Supabase
- ✅ Order history page functional
- ✅ Order tracking working
- ✅ All files modified as required
- ✅ Professional implementation with error handling
