# ✅ Checkout with Address Selection - Complete

## Overview

The checkout flow now includes a **professional address selection system** that:
- ✅ Shows saved addresses for logged-in users
- ✅ Allows users to select from saved addresses
- ✅ Provides form for new addresses (guests or new address)
- ✅ Supports separate billing address
- ✅ Shows order summary during checkout
- ✅ Validates all required fields before payment

---

## The Correct E-Commerce Checkout Workflow

### ✅ NEW Professional Workflow

```
1. Cart Page
   User reviews items → Clicks "Proceed to Checkout"
   ↓
2. Checkout Page (NEW!)
   - Shows order summary
   - User selects/enters shipping address
   - User selects/enters billing address (or same as shipping)
   - Validates all fields
   - Clicks "Continue to Payment"
   ↓
3. Stripe Payment Page
   - Stripe hosted checkout
   - Secure payment processing
   - Stripe collects payment details ONLY
   ↓
4. Success Page
   - Order confirmation
   - Cart cleared
   - Order details displayed
```

### ❌ OLD Flawed Workflow (Before Fix)

```
1. Cart Page → Clicks "Proceed to Checkout"
   ↓
2. Immediately redirects to Stripe
   ❌ No address collection
   ❌ No order review
   ❌ Bad user experience
```

## Address Data Transformation

### From Saved Address to Order Format

```typescript

{
  id: "uuid",
  name: "Home",
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  address_line_1: "123 Main St",
  address_line_2: "Apt 4B",
  city: "New York",
  state: "NY",
  postal_code: "10001",
  country: "US",
  phone: "+1234567890"
}

// Transformed to Order Format
{
  fullName: "John Doe",
  address: "123 Main St",
  address2: "Apt 4B",
  city: "New York",
  state: "NY",
  zipCode: "10001",
  country: "US",
  phone: "+1234567890"
}
```

### From Form Input to Order Format

```typescript
// Form State
{
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  company: "",
  address_line_1: "123 Main St",
  address_line_2: "",
  city: "New York",
  state: "NY",
  postal_code: "10001",
  country: "US",
  phone: "+1234567890"
}

  address2: "",
  city: "New York",
  state: "NY",
  zipCode: "10001",
  country: "US",
