## What Was Enhanced

### 1. Enhanced Database Schema

| `metadata`            | JSONB         | Additional order metadata                          |

**Performance Indexes Added:**

- `idx_orders_user_id` - Fast lookup by user
- `idx_orders_email` - Fast lookup by email
- `idx_orders_status` - Filter by order status
- `idx_orders_created_at` - Sort by date (DESC)
- `idx_orders_stripe_session_id` - Lookup by Stripe session
- `idx_orders_stripe_payment_intent_id` - Lookup by payment intent

**Analytics View Created:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW order_analytics AS
SELECT
    DATE(created_at) as order_date,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(total_amount) as average_order_value,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'delivered' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as delivered_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'cancelled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as cancelled_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
```

### 2. Enhanced Webhook Handler

**File:** `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**Now Captures:**

#### Shipping Address from Stripe

```typescript
if (fullSession.shipping_details?.address) {
  const stripeAddress = fullSession.shipping_details.address;
  shippingAddress = {
    fullName: fullSession.shipping_details.name || customerName,
    address: stripeAddress.line1 || "",
    address2: stripeAddress.line2 || "",
    city: stripeAddress.city || "",
    state: stripeAddress.state || "",
    zipCode: stripeAddress.postal_code || "",
    country: stripeAddress.country || "",
    phone: fullSession.customer_details?.phone || "",
  };
}
```

#### Billing Address from Stripe

```typescript
if (fullSession.customer_details?.address) {
  billingAddress = {
    fullName: customerName,
    address: billingAddr.line1 || "",
    // ... full address details
  };
}
```

#### Price Breakdown

```typescript
const discountAmount = fullSession.total_details?.amount_discount / 100 || 0;
const shippingCost = fullSession.total_details?.amount_shipping / 100 || 0;
const taxAmount = fullSession.total_details?.amount_tax / 100 || 0;
const subtotal = totalAmount - shippingCost - taxAmount + discountAmount;
```

### 3. Enhanced Order Service

**File:** `services/orders/order.service.ts`

**Now Saves:**

```typescript
{
  // User info
  user_id: orderData.userId || null,
  email: orderData.email,
  customer_name: customerName,
  customer_phone: customerPhone,

  // Pricing breakdown
  subtotal: orderData.subtotal,
  discount: orderData.discount,
  shipping: orderData.shipping,
  tax: 0,
  total_amount: orderData.total,
  currency: "USD",

  // Addresses
  shipping_address: orderData.shippingAddress,
  billing_address: orderData.billingAddress,

  // Items and payment
  items: orderData.items,
  payment_method: "card",
  stripe_session_id: orderData.stripeSessionId,
  stripe_payment_intent_id: orderData.paymentIntentId,

  // Status
  status: orderData.status,

  // Timestamps
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
}
```
