# Product Filters & Dashboard Fixes

**Date:** January 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Build Status:** ✅ PASSED

---

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Product Filters Not Working

**Problem:**

- Filters on `/products` page were static and non-functional
- No URL-based filtering
- No connection to product data

**Solution:**

- Converted `ProductFilters` component to fully functional client component
- Implemented URL-based filtering using `useSearchParams` and `useRouter`
- Added React `useTransition` for smooth, non-blocking filter updates
- Implemented proper state management with `useMemo` and `useCallback` for performance

**Features Added:**

- ✅ Category filtering (boxes, bubble-wrap, packing-tape, etc.)
- ✅ Size filtering (small, medium, large, extra-large)
- ✅ Material filtering (cardboard, plastic, paper, foam, metal)
- ✅ Eco-friendly filtering (recyclable, biodegradable, compostable, recycled-content)
- ✅ Price range slider ($0-$1000)
- ✅ Active filter badges showing count
- ✅ "Clear All" button to reset filters
- ✅ Loading indicator during filter updates
- ✅ Persistent filters in URL (shareable)

### 2. ✅ Products Page Integration

**Problem:**

- Products page wasn't reading filter params
- Sorting wasn't working
- No integration with Sanity's filtering capabilities

**Solution:**

- Updated `/products` page to parse all filter params from URL
- Integrated with `getFilteredProducts` service
- Added client-side price range filtering
- Created `ProductSort` component for sorting functionality
- Made page dynamic (`force-dynamic`) for proper SSR

**Features:**

- ✅ Server-side filtering via Sanity
- ✅ Client-side price filtering
- ✅ Sorting: newest, oldest, price (low/high), name (A-Z, Z-A)
- ✅ Real-time product count display
- ✅ Smooth transitions with React 18 `useTransition`

### 3. ✅ Saved Addresses Functionality

**Status:** Already working correctly!

**Verified:**

- ✅ Loading addresses from Supabase
- ✅ Adding new addresses
- ✅ Editing existing addresses
- ✅ Deleting addresses
- ✅ Setting default address (unsets others automatically)
- ✅ Real-time UI updates
- ✅ Form validation

### 4. ✅ Account Settings Functionality

**Status:** Already working correctly!

**Verified:**

- ✅ Loading user profile from `useAuth`
- ✅ Updating profile (name, phone, company)
- ✅ Changing password with validation
- ✅ Success/error messages
- ✅ Loading states during submission
- ✅ Form validation (password length, matching passwords)
- ✅ Authentication gate (redirects if not logged in)

### 5. ✅ Account Dashboard

**Status:** Already working correctly!

**Verified:**

- ✅ Real order statistics (total orders, total spent, average order)
- ✅ Recent orders display (last 3)
- ✅ Dynamic status badges
- ✅ Authentication gate
- ✅ Links to order details

## 🎨 Best Practices Implemented

### Performance Optimizations

1. **React 18 Transitions**

   ```tsx
   const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

   startTransition(() => {
     router.push(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`, { scroll: false });
   });
   ```

   - Non-blocking UI updates
   - Smooth user experience during filtering

2. **Memoization**

   ```tsx
   const activeFilters = useMemo(() => {
     // Parse filters from URL
   }, [searchParams]);
   ```

   - Prevents unnecessary recalculations
   - Only updates when searchParams change

3. **Callback Optimization**

   ```tsx
   const updateFilters = useCallback(
     (key, value, checked) => {
       // Update logic
     },
     [searchParams, pathname, router]
   );
   ```

   - Stable function references
   - Prevents child component re-renders

4. **URL-Based State**
   - No local state management needed
   - Shareable filter URLs
   - Browser back/forward works naturally
   - No state synchronization issues

5. **Scroll Prevention**
   ```tsx
   router.push(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`, { scroll: false });
   ```

   - Smooth filtering without page jumps
   - Better UX

### Code Quality

1. **TypeScript**
   - Proper interfaces for all props
   - Type-safe filter operations

2. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch in all async operations
   - Graceful fallbacks

3. **Loading States**
   - `isPending` indicator during transitions
   - Disabled states on inputs

4. **Accessibility**
   - Proper label associations
   - Checkbox ARIA attributes
   - Keyboard navigation support
