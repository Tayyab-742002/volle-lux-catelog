# ‚úÖ Task 2.4.2: Order Confirmation Email - COMPLETE

## Overview

Task 2.4.2 from Phase 2.4 (Resend Email Integration) is now complete! Order confirmation emails are automatically sent after successful Stripe payments.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

### Integration with Stripe Webhook ‚úÖ

**File Modified:** `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

Added email sending logic after order creation in the `handleCheckoutSessionCompleted` function:

```typescript
// Send order confirmation email
try {
  // Import dynamically to avoid issues if Resend is not configured
  const { sendOrderConfirmationEmail } = await import(
    "@/services/emails/email.service"
  );
  const { getOrderById } = await import("@/services/orders/order.service");

  // Fetch the complete order details
  const order = await getOrderById(orderId);

  if (order && userEmail) {
    const emailResult = await sendOrderConfirmationEmail(order, userEmail);

    if (emailResult.success) {
      console.log(
        `‚úÖ Order confirmation email sent to ${userEmail} (Message ID: ${emailResult.messageId})`
      );
    } else {
      console.error(
        `‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to send order confirmation email: ${emailResult.error}`
      );
    }
  } else {
    console.warn("‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping email: Missing order or email address");
  }
} catch (emailError) {
  // Log email error but don't fail the order
  console.error("‚ö†Ô∏è Error sending confirmation email:", emailError);
  console.log("Order created successfully, but email failed to send");
}
```

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Automatic Email Sending ‚úÖ

- **Trigger:** After successful Stripe payment
- **Timing:** Immediately after order is created in database
- **Reliability:** Non-blocking (order succeeds even if email fails)

### 2. Complete Order Information ‚úÖ

The email includes:

- ‚úÖ Order number and date
- ‚úÖ Customer email
- ‚úÖ All ordered items with quantities and prices
- ‚úÖ Order summary (subtotal, discount, shipping, total)
- ‚úÖ Shipping address
- ‚úÖ "View Order Details" button linking to order page
- ‚úÖ Support contact information

### 3. Error Handling ‚úÖ

- **Dynamic imports:** Prevents build errors if Resend not configured
- **Try-catch blocks:** Email errors don't fail the order
- **Comprehensive logging:** Success, failure, and warning messages
- **Graceful degradation:** Order still created if email service unavailable

### 4. Development Safety ‚úÖ

- **Test mode:** In development, emails go to `RESEND_TEST_EMAIL`
- **Console logs:** Detailed logging for debugging
- **No production impact:** Safe to test without affecting real customers

## üìß Email Flow

```
1. Customer completes Stripe payment
   ‚Üì
2. Stripe sends webhook to /api/webhooks/stripe
   ‚Üì
3. Webhook handler processes checkout.session.completed event
   ‚Üì
4. Order created in Supabase database
   ‚Üì
5. Order ID returned
   ‚Üì
6. Fetch complete order details from database
   ‚Üì
7. Send order confirmation email via Resend
   ‚Üì
8. Log email success/failure
   ‚Üì
9. Return success to Stripe (even if email fails)
```

**Why non-blocking:** Orders should succeed even if email service has issues. Emails can be resent manually if needed.
