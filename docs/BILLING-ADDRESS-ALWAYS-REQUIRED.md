# ✅ Billing Address Always Required - Updated

## Overview

The checkout flow has been updated so that **billing address is ALWAYS required** during checkout. This is a common practice for payment processing and fraud prevention.

---

## What Changed

### Before (❌ Optional Billing)

```tsx
// Checkbox: "Same as shipping address" (default: checked)
// User could skip billing address entry
<input type="checkbox" checked={true} />;
{
  !sameAsBilling && <BillingForm />;
}
```

### After (✅ Always Required)

```tsx
// Button: "Copy from Shipping Address"
// Billing form ALWAYS shown
// User must fill it in (can copy from shipping for convenience)
<Button onClick={copyShippingToBilling}>
  Copy from Shipping Address
</Button>
<BillingForm /> {/* Always visible */}
```

---

## Changes Made

### 1. State Initialization

**Before:**

```typescript
const [sameAsBilling, setSameAsBilling] = useState(true);
```

**After:**

```typescript
const [sameAsBilling, setSameAsBilling] = useState(false);
// Note: Variable kept for backward compatibility but not used for hiding form
```

### 2. UI Changes

**Before:**

- Checkbox: "Same as shipping address"
- Billing form hidden by default
- User could proceed without filling billing

**After:**

- Button: "Copy from Shipping Address"
- Billing form ALWAYS visible
- User must fill all required billing fields

### 3. Copy Functionality

Added smart copy button that:

- Copies from shipping form (for guests or new address)
- Copies from selected saved address (for logged-in users)
- One-click convenience without skipping the form

```typescript
<Button
  type="button"
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => {
    if (useNewAddress || !user?.id || !selectedAddressId) {
      // Copy from shipping form
      setBillingForm({ ...shippingForm });
    } else {
      // Copy from selected saved address
      const selectedAddr = savedAddresses.find(
        (a) => a.id === selectedAddressId
      );
      if (selectedAddr) {
        setBillingForm({
          first_name: selectedAddr.first_name,
          last_name: selectedAddr.last_name,
          // ... all fields
        });
      }
    }
  }}
>
  Copy from Shipping Address
</Button>
```

### 4. Validation Logic

**Before:**

```typescript
if (sameAsBilling) {
  billingAddress = shippingAddress;
} else {
  // Validate billing form
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
// ALWAYS validate billing form
if (
  !billingForm.first_name ||
  !billingForm.last_name ||
  !billingForm.address_line_1 ||
  !billingForm.city ||
  !billingForm.state ||
  !billingForm.postal_code
) {
  throw new Error("Please fill in all required billing address fields");
}

billingAddress = {
  fullName: `${billingForm.first_name} ${billingForm.last_name}`,
  // ... create billing address
};
```
