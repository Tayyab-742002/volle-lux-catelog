## 🔧 Technical Details

### URL Structure

All filtering uses query parameters:

```
/products                           # All products
/products?category=eco-friendly     # Category filter
/products?category=gift-boxes&sort=price-low  # Category + sort
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ SEO-friendly URLs
- ✅ Shareable links
- ✅ Browser history works
- ✅ State persists on refresh

### Slug Transformation

```typescript
const categoryDisplayName = activeCategory
  ? activeCategory
      .split("-")
      .map((word) => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
      .join(" ")
  : null;

// "eco-friendly" → "Eco Friendly"
// "gift-boxes" → "Gift Boxes"
```

### Dynamic Breadcrumbs

```typescript
<Breadcrumbs
  items={[
    { label: "Products", href: "/products" },
    ...(categoryDisplayName
      ? [{ label: categoryDisplayName, href: `/products?category=${activeCategory}` }]
      : []),
  ]}
/>
